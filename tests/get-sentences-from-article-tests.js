      'A methane molecule is made from one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.',
      'Carbon has a mass of 12.011 u and hydrogen has a mass of 1.008 u.',
      'This means that the mass of one methane molecule is 12.011 u + (4*1.008u), or 16.043 u.',
      'This means that one mole of methane has a mass of 16.043 grams.',
      'A mole can be thought of as two bags of different sized balls.',
      'One bag contains 3 tennis balls and the other 3 footballs.',
      'There is the same number of balls in both bags but the mass of the footballs is much larger.',
      'It is a different way to measure things.',
      'Moles measure the number of particles, not the mass.',
      'So both bags contain three moles.',
      'A mole is simply a unit of the number of things.',
      'Units are invented when existing units can not describe something well enough.',
      'Chemical reactions often take place at levels where using grams wouldn\'t make sense, yet using absolute numbers of atoms/molecules/ions would be confusing, too.'
